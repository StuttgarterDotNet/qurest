QuRest is an academical prototype with the intention to show how **classical control structures** like loops and conditionals can be implemented in a **gate-based quantum circuit model**. 
This can be achieved by introducing so-called **model variables**, i.e. variables that needs to be mapped to real values at compile-time but can be used freely when modelling a quantum circuit.


The following example shows the preparation of a *GHZ-State* with *n* qubits using a for loop:

```csharp
var qc = new QuantumCircuit()
    .WithName("N-Qubit-GHZ")
    .WithDescription("Prepares a N qubit GHZ state.")
    .WithSize("N")
    .H("0")
    .For("i", "0", "N-1", "1")
        .CX("i", "i+1")
    .EndFor();
```

The output of the compilation with *N=4*:

## Getting Started
The easiest way of using the prototype is via the [official docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/stuttgarterdotnet/qurest).
If docker is installed, executing

```ps
docker run -d -p 88:80 stuttgarterdotnet/qurest
```
will run a container with the QuRest image listening on port 88.
The swagger ui can than be accessed via [http://localhost:88/swagger](http://localhost:88/swagger).
